# Timetable-TE18C-ED
Timetable-TE18C-ED is a timetable for the calculator TI-84 Plus CE. You can customize it by changing lessons and adding new features.

## Installing

Installing can be done through the official software [TI-Connect CE](https://education.ti.com/en/products/computer-software/ti-connect-ce-sw). You can use the TIMETBLC.8xp included, or make one yourself.

1. Use [TI-Connect CE](https://education.ti.com/en/products/computer-software/ti-connect-ce-sw) to install the four libraries located in the bin folder, fileio.8xv, graphx.8xv, keypad.8xv, libload.8xv.
2. Use [TI-Connect CE](https://education.ti.com/en/products/computer-software/ti-connect-ce-sw) to install TIMETABLEC.8xp located in the bin folder.
3. If using an older calculator OS, which will give you a Syntax error message, install the Launcher.8xp, also located in the bin folder. Now you can start the program TIMETBL instead, which just will start TIMETBLC.8xp in Asm mode (Asm(prgmTIMETBLC)).
